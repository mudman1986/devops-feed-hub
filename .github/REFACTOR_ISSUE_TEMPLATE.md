Review the codebase and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Suggested Areas to Review

- Code quality and maintainability
- Test coverage and reliability
- UI improvements
- Documentation completeness
- Performance optimizations
- Security best practices
- Code duplication
- Error handling
- Dependencies and updates

## Guidelines

- Prioritize high-impact, low-risk improvements
- Make focused, incremental changes
- Run existing tests and linters before completing
- Document any significant changes
- Consider backward compatibility
- **Delegate tasks to suitable agents** in the `.github/agents` folder when available

**Note:** If the scope is too large for a single session, create additional issues with the `refactor` label for remaining work.
