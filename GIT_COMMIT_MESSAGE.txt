refactor: Separate action from workflow scripts for future extraction

PROBLEM FIXED:
The RSS feed collector action contained scripts (generate_summary.py,
generate_rss.py) that were called directly by workflows. This created
a hard dependency that would break when extracting the action to a
separate repository.

SOLUTION:
Separated data collection (action) from presentation (workflow scripts):
- Action: Collects feeds, outputs JSON (portable)
- Workflow scripts: Generate HTML/RSS (project-specific)

CHANGES:

Action (actions/collect-rss-feeds/):
  Modified:
    - action.yml: Now uses generate_markdown_summary.py
    - README.md: Updated to reflect lightweight design
    - tests/test_collect_feeds.py: Updated test expectations
    - tests/README.md: Updated documentation
  
  Added:
    + generate_markdown_summary.py: Minimal markdown generation for action
  
  Removed:
    - generate_summary.py (moved to workflow scripts)
    - generate_rss.py (moved to workflow scripts)
    - utils.py (moved to workflow scripts)
    - template.html (moved to workflow scripts)
    - tests/test_generate_summary.py (moved)
    - tests/test_generate_rss.py (moved)
    - tests/test_feed_ordering.py (moved)

Workflow Scripts (.github/workflows/scripts/):
  Added:
    + rss-processing/generate_summary.py: Full HTML generation
    + rss-processing/generate_rss.py: RSS feed generation
    + rss-processing/utils.py: Shared utilities
    + rss-processing/template.html: HTML template
    + rss-processing/tests/test_generate_summary.py
    + rss-processing/tests/test_generate_rss.py
    + rss-processing/tests/test_feed_ordering.py
    + rss-processing/README.md
    + rss-processing/tests/README.md
  
  Modified:
    - README.md: Documented new rss-processing directory

Workflows:
  Modified:
    - rss-github-page.yml: Uses .github/workflows/scripts/rss-processing/
    - ui-tests.yml: Uses .github/workflows/scripts/rss-processing/
    - ci-tests.yml: Tests both action and workflow scripts

Documentation:
  Added:
    + FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md: Complete structure documentation
    + REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md: Detailed refactoring explanation
    + EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md: Step-by-step extraction instructions
  
  Modified:
    - actions/README.md: Updated for separation of concerns
    - TESTING.md: Updated test paths and commands
    - docs/README.md: Updated script references
    - scripts/README.md: Clarified script locations
    - scripts/test/generate-test-data.sh: Uses new path
    - .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md: Updated test commands

TESTING:
✓ All 75 tests passing (10 action + 65 workflow scripts)
✓ No functionality changes
✓ Workflows verified to use correct paths

BENEFITS:
- Action is now extraction-ready
- Clear separation of concerns
- No breaking changes to functionality
- Improved maintainability
- Better documentation

NEXT STEPS:
When ready to extract the action, follow EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md
