# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and aim to promptly address any vulnerabilities. The table below indicates which versions of **DevOps Feed Hub** are currently supported with security updates:

| Version           | Supported |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| main (latest)     | ✅        |

Only the latest version (main branch) is supported. Please update to the latest version to ensure you receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2. Please email the maintainers at: **<plantjes_fee40@icloud.com>**.
3. Include as much detail as possible so we can quickly address the issue:
   - The version used
   - Reproduction steps
   - Impact assessment
   - Your suggested remediation (if any)

We aim to respond to all security reports within 72 hours. After the initial reply, we will keep you informed of our progress as we investigate and mitigate the vulnerability.

## Security Best Practices

- Always run the latest version for the latest security fixes.
- Never share sensitive data (API keys, passwords) in issues or PRs.
- Do not commit secret credentials to the repository. We use [GitHub's secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning) to monitor for exposed secrets.
- Regularly audit dependencies and apply updates.

Thank you for helping keep DevOps Feed Hub and its users safe!
