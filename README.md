## Hi there 👋

I did the github course and therefore I now have a profile repo

## 📰 Automated RSS Feed Collection

This repository includes automated workflows that collect and distribute news articles from various tech RSS feeds:

- **Scheduled Updates**: Runs automatically on weekdays at 9 AM UTC
- **Email Delivery**: Sends updates directly to your email (recommended for personal accounts)
- **Alternative Platforms**: Also supports MS Teams channels, Slack, and Discord
- **Smart Fetching**: Only fetches new articles since the last run
- **Configurable Feeds**: Easy to add or remove RSS feeds

📖 [View Documentation](.github/workflows/RSS_FEED_WORKFLOW.md)

**Note**: Email workflow is enabled by default. MS Teams webhooks only work for channels, not personal accounts.
